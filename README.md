# Instagram-Downloader
This program is a mix of experiments that I wanted to do about classes and modules, so the code is a completely mess (I wonder how I wonder why everything works).     
It's also my "test" about tkinter (what I was able to do with that library)

# Guide
* To download private posts (you must follow the profile) you have to log in with your Instagram account, if you are not logged-in will be downloaded only the profile picture
* The downloaded posts will be in the folder "posts", which will be created when you download your first post. It's located with the README file

# Attention Required
* If you open the menu or the login you have to close them with their closure arrows. If you don't do that you will be unable to close them until the restart of the app  
* You mustn't delete or rename the files in the folder

# I'm sorry
### I'm sorry for all the bad code you'll read (probably everything)
### If you want you can help me to improve :)
